				Effective: April 14, 2017 </div>
				
				
				<h3>Introduction </h3>
				<p>Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect at Habla AI, how Habla AI uses it, and what choices you have.
				When we talk about “Habla AI,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this policy, we are referring to Habla AI, Inc., the company which provides the Services. 
				When we talk about the “Services” in this policy, we are referring to our online Cognitive Knowledge Graph(CKG), 
				Graphically Enabled Semantic Search Engine(GESSE), Teams and Team Rooms, Habla APIs, and other platform services. 
				Our Services are currently available for use by means of a web browser or applications specific to your desktop or iOS and Android mobile device, 
				as further described in our <a href="/#" className="blue-link">Help Center.</a>
				</p>
				<h3>Information we collect and receive </h3>
				
				
				<h4>1. Subscriber Data</h4>
				<p>Content and information submitted by users to the Services is referred to in this policy as <b>“Subscriber Data.”</b> As further explained below, Subscriber Data is controlled by the organization or other third party that created the team (the <b>“Subscriber”</b>). Where Habla AI collects or processes Subscriber Data, it does so on behalf of the Subscriber. Here are some examples of Subscriber Data (keep in mind they are only examples and there may be others): messages (including those in Habla AI Teams, Team Rooms, XMPP Voice and Video, and direct messages), pictures, videos, edits to messages or deleted messages, and other types of files. A user may also choose to enter information into her/his profile, such as first and last name, job, an avatar or profile photo and a phone number.
				</p>
				<p>If you join a team and create a user account, you are a “user,” as further described in the <Link to="/#" className="blue-link">User Terms of Service</Link> . If you are using the Services by invitation of a Subscriber, whether that Subscriber is your employer, another organization, or an individual, that Subscriber determines its own policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Subscriber Data which may apply to your use of the Services. Please check with the Subscriber about the policies and settings it has in place.<br />
				</p>
				<h4>2. Other information</h4>

				<p>Habla AI may also collect and receive the following information:</p>
				<ul className="privacy-list">

					<li><b>Account creation information</b>. Users provide information such as an email address and password to create an account.

					</li>
					<li><b>Third party data</b>. Habla AI may also receive information from affiliates in our corporate group, our partners, or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful.

				<h3>Our Cookie Policy</h3>
				<p>
				Habla AI uses cookies and similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data. We use both session-based and persistent cookies.
				</p>
				<p>
				Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer and from your computer or mobile device to us each time you visit our website or use our desktop application. They are unique to your account or your browser. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.
				</p>
				<p>
				Some cookies are associated with your account and personal information in order to remember that you are logged in and which teams you are logged into. Other cookies are not tied to your account but are unique and allow us to carry out site analytics and customization, among other similar things. If you access the Services through your browser, you can manage your cookie settings there but if you disable some or all cookies you may not be able to use the Services.

				Habla AI sets and accesses our own cookies on the domains operated by Habla AI and its corporate affiliates. In addition, we use third parties like Google Analytics for website analytics. You may opt-out of third party cookies from Google Analytics on its website. We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.<br />
